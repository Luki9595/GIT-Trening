            <p>Why are you never real?
            Whenever you appear<br>
            You leave me with that grace<br>
            I am trembling with fear<br>
            But I know that you will disappear<br>
            Just as I awake<br>
            Whisper in my ear<br>
            <br>
            Well, I believe<br>
            Somewhere in the past<br>
            Something was between<br>
            You and I, my dear<br>
            And it remains<br>
            With me to this day<br>
            No matter what I do<br>
            This scar will never fade<br>
            <br>
            So let's make trouble in the dream world<br>
            Hijack heaven with another memory now<br>
            I make the most of the turning tide<br>
            It just split what's left of the burning silence<br>
            Don't wait, 'cause this could be the last time<br>
            You turn up in the reveries of my mind<br>
            I wake up to a suicide frenzy<br>
            Loaded dreams still leave me empty<br>
            <br>
            I believe<br>
            Somewhere in the past<br>
            Something was between<br>
            You and I my dear<br>
            And it remains<br>
            With me to this day<br>
            No matter what I do<br>
            This wound will never heal<br>
            <br>
            Why are you never real?<br>
            The shifting states you follow me through<br>
            Unrevealed<br>
            Just let me go or take me with you<br>
            <br>
            So let's make trouble in the dream world<br>
            Hijack heaven with another memory now<br>
            I make the most of the turning tide<br>
            It just split what's left of the burning silence<br>
            Don't wait 'cause this could be the last time<br>
            You turn up in the reveries of my mind<br>
            I wake up to a suicide frenzy<br>
